# Escaping the Build Trap (2019)

## Part 1: The Build Trap

- **Build Trap**: Organizations measure success by outputs (features delivered) rather than outcomes (customer value).
- Focuses on shipping features rather than solving real problems for customers, leading to disruption and loss of market share.
- To escape the Build Trap, companies must develop robust _product management_ practices that focus on creating customer value.

### The Value Exchange System

- Customers have problems, wants, and needs; businesses provide products or services to fulfill them.
- Value is realized only when products solve customer problems, leading to reciprocal business value.
- Companies often equate value with the number of features delivered rather than the real customer outcomes.

### Constraints on the Value Exchange System

- Customers are influenced by external factors (community, technology).
- Businesses are constrained by internal policies, processes, and resources, which need to be optimized for delivering customer value.

### Projects Versus Products Versus Services

- **Projects**: Discrete, one-off scopes of work with deadlines.
- **Products**: Continuous vehicles of value that need ongoing attention and development.
- **Services**: Human-delivered value propositions.
- Companies in the Build Trap tend to manage their products like projects, leading to a lack of strategic growth.

### The Product-Led Organization

- **Sales-Led**: Product strategy is driven by contracts and customer promises, leading to feature bloat.
- **Visionary-Led**: Relies on a visionary leader for product direction, often unsustainable when that person leaves.
- **Technology-Led**: Driven by tech advancements rather than market needs, leading to misalignment with customer desires.
- **Product-Led**: Optimizes for business outcomes by aligning product strategy with company goals, continually creating value for customers.

### What We Know and What We Donâ€™t

- Product development is filled with unknowns, and it is important to distinguish between what is known and what still needs to be discovered:
  - **Known Knowns**: These are facts that are well-established, such as customer requirements, data from past performance, or regulatory needs. Known knowns are reliable and should be treated as the foundation for decision-making in product development.
  - **Known Unknowns**: These are assumptions or uncertainties you know you need to clarify. These might include gaps in understanding customer behavior or missing data points. These are areas that can be investigated through _experimentation_, _customer feedback_, or _research_ to turn them into known facts.
  - **Unknown Knowns**: These refer to _intuitions_ or gut feelings based on past experiences. Although intuition can be valuable, it is also where _bias_ can thrive. Intuition must be tested and validated through experimentation before being used to drive decisions.
  - **Unknown Unknowns**: These are the factors or issues that you do not even know exist, making them impossible to ask questions about or plan for. They often emerge unexpectedly during _customer interactions_ or while analyzing unrelated data, revealing insights that could reshape your product or strategy.
- Product managers must focus on identifying and exploring the _known unknowns_ while reducing the impact of _unknown unknowns_ through constant learning and iteration.
