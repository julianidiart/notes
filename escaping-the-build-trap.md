# Escaping the Build Trap (2019)

## Part I: The Build Trap

- **Build Trap**: Organizations measure success by outputs (features delivered) rather than outcomes (customer value).
- Focuses on shipping features rather than solving real problems for customers, leading to disruption and loss of market share.
- To escape the Build Trap, companies must develop robust _product management_ practices that focus on creating customer value.

### Chapter 1: The Value Exchange System

- Customers have problems, wants, and needs; businesses provide products or services to fulfill them.
- Value is realized only when products solve customer problems, leading to reciprocal business value.
- Companies often equate value with the number of features delivered rather than the real customer outcomes.

### Chapter 2: Constraints on the Value Exchange System

- Customers are influenced by external factors (community, technology).
- Businesses are constrained by internal policies, processes, and resources, which need to be optimized for delivering customer value.

### Chapter 3: Projects Versus Products Versus Services

- **Projects**: Discrete, one-off scopes of work with deadlines.
- **Products**: Continuous vehicles of value that need ongoing attention and development.
- **Services**: Human-delivered value propositions.
- Companies in the Build Trap tend to manage their products like projects, leading to a lack of strategic growth.

### Chapter 4: The Product-Led Organization

- **Sales-Led**: Product strategy is driven by contracts and customer promises, leading to feature bloat.
- **Visionary-Led**: Relies on a visionary leader for product direction, often unsustainable when that person leaves.
- **Technology-Led**: Driven by tech advancements rather than market needs, leading to misalignment with customer desires.
- **Product-Led**: Optimizes for business outcomes by aligning product strategy with company goals, continually creating value for customers.

### Chapter 5: What We Know and What We Don’t

- Product development is filled with unknowns, and it is important to distinguish between what is known and what still needs to be discovered:
  - **Known Knowns**: These are facts that are well-established, such as customer requirements, data from past performance, or regulatory needs. Known knowns are reliable and should be treated as the foundation for decision-making in product development.
  - **Known Unknowns**: These are assumptions or uncertainties you know you need to clarify. These might include gaps in understanding customer behavior or missing data points. These are areas that can be investigated through _experimentation_, _customer feedback_, or _research_ to turn them into known facts.
  - **Unknown Knowns**: These refer to _intuitions_ or gut feelings based on past experiences. Although intuition can be valuable, it is also where _bias_ can thrive. Intuition must be tested and validated through experimentation before being used to drive decisions.
  - **Unknown Unknowns**: These are the factors or issues that you do not even know exist, making them impossible to ask questions about or plan for. They often emerge unexpectedly during _customer interactions_ or while analyzing unrelated data, revealing insights that could reshape your product or strategy.
- Product managers must focus on identifying and exploring the _known unknowns_ while reducing the impact of _unknown unknowns_ through constant learning and iteration.

## Part II: The Role of the Product Manager

### Chapter 6: Bad Product Manager Archetypes

- **Mini-CEO Archetype**: Effective product managers rely on influence, not authority.
- **Waiter Archetype**: Takes orders from stakeholders without understanding or questioning. Lacks strategic thinking and prioritization, leading to a feature-factory mindset.
- **Former Project Manager Archetype**: Focuses on deadlines and deliverables rather than the “why” behind product decisions. Lacks understanding of customer problems and how to create business value.

### Chapter 7: A Great Product Manager

- Understand business goals, user problems, and market needs.
- Work collaboratively with teams, influence decision-making, and guide product vision.
- Product managers should focus on identifying and validating customer problems before proposing solutions.
- Effective product managers facilitate the team’s collective knowledge.
- Successful product managers listen, learn, and use data to make decisions, not ego or intuition.

### Chapter 8: The Product Manager Career Path

  - Entry role, often lacks formal training in product management.
  - Must develop foundational skills in working with development teams and gathering customer insights.
- **Product Manager**:
  - Owns a feature or set of features.
  - Balances short-term operational tasks with long-term strategic thinking.
  - Works with UX and development to deliver solutions.
- **Senior Product Manager**:
  - Oversees more complex products or a broader scope.
  - Balances strategic vision and operational responsibilities without direct reports.
- **Director of Product**:

- **Chief Product Officer (CPO)**:

### Chapter 9: Organizing Your Teams

- Organizing around technical components or features can lead to inefficient work and lack of alignment with goals.
- Aligning teams with _value streams_ helps to focus on delivering outcomes and customer value.
- Teams organized around strategic goals (e.g., retention, new users) rather than product features or components.
- Product teams should be aligned with clear product vision and strategy to ensure successful execution.
