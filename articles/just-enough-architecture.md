# [Just Enough Architecture by Maxi Ferreira (2024)](https://frontendatscale.com/issues/13/)

> “Big design up-front is dumb. Doing no design up-front is even dumber.”

- The challenge lies in finding the right amount of upfront design—too much wastes time, too little causes tech debt.

- **Boehm’s research**

  - The ideal level of architecture depends on project size and volatility, with larger projects requiring more upfront design.
  - Every project has a **sweet spot** where architecture is _"just enough"_ to minimize rework without over-committing.

- **Evolutionary architecture**

  - _Simon Brown_ suggests starting with some design but leaving room for adjustments as the project evolves.
  - Before starting, understand the problem you're solving, the _quality attributes_ that matter, and confirm that your architecture addresses them.

- Developers should know the _components_ involved and how they interact, rather than just focusing on tools like React.
- Clear _architectural documentation_ and _diagrams_ are essential for sharing the design vision with the team.
- Early identification of _risks_, like unfamiliar technology, helps mitigate problems before development starts.

- **Iterate, don’t perfect**

  - Architecture should evolve; aim for flexibility rather than a perfect design set in stone.
  - Initial architecture should be a guiding framework, with the flexibility to change as the project progresses.
