# [Go Deep, Then Go Broad by Maxi Ferreira (2023)](https://frontendatscale.com/issues/3/)

- **The Pyramid of Knowledge**

  - The **pyramid model** organizes knowledge into three levels:
    - Top Level (_Technical Depth_): The _expertise_ you have, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the frameworks you use regularly.
    - Middle Level (_Awareness of Gaps_): Technologies and concepts you _understand at a high level_ but haven't fully mastered, such as unfamiliar frameworks, languages, or architectural principles.
    - Bottom Level (_Unknowns_): The technologies or concepts you are entirely _unaware_ of, which might include unfamiliar programming languages, tools, or deeply technical areas like compilers.

- **Depth and Breadth**

  - **Technical Depth**: Early in your career, focus on developing deep _expertise_ in your area of specialization.
  - **Technical Breadth**: As you advance, focus on _expanding_ your knowledge horizontally by learning about areas outside of your expertise.
    > "Developing your technical breadth will feel uncomfortable at times, but it's one of the best ways to level up your frontend engineer career."

- **Why Breadth Matters**

  1. Operating at the Staff+ Level: As you take on roles like Tech Lead or Architect, a _broader understanding_ becomes more valuable than deep technical skills.
  2. Breaking Through the _"Frontend Ceiling"_: Broadening your skills allows for more _career growth_ and positions beyond the typical limitations of frontend engineering.
  3. Better Software Design: A broader set of skills enables _better decision-making_ and trade-off analysis when solving problems.

- **Generalist vs. Specialist Debate**

  - The answer to whether you should be a generalist or a specialist is: _both_, but _at different stages of your career_.
  - **First go deep**: Focus on becoming an expert in an area youâ€™re passionate about.
  - **Then go broad**: Develop a wider understanding across different areas to boost your overall effectiveness and career potential.
