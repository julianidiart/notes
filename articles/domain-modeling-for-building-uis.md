# [Domain Modeling for Building UIs by Maxi Ferreira (2024)](https://frontendatscale.com/issues/25/)

- **Domain modeling for UIs**

  - Domain modeling helps to break down a UI project by identifying entities and their relationships.

- **Identifying core entities**

  - Understanding entities like `customer` and `restaurant` helps structure a UI codebase consistently and logically.

- **Naming consistency**

  - Domain modeling helps establish consistent terms, like ensuring `customers` are always called `customers` across the codebase.

- **Attributes and operations**

  - _Attributes_ (e.g., name, logo) and _operations_ (e.g., adding an item to the cart) help define how entities behave within the UI.

- **Reducing development time**

  - Predefining entity structures saves time during coding, especially in _TypeScript_ or object-oriented environments.

- **Clarifying responsibilities**

  - Domain modeling raises essential questions, such as which entity should handle actions like adding items to a shopping cart.

- **Adapting APIs**

  - API data doesn’t always fit the UI's needs, so domain modeling ensures that API data structures are efficiently translated for the frontend.

- **Early conversations**:

  - Discussing model decisions early prevents confusion and time-consuming changes during implementation.

- **Staying agile**

  - Domain models shouldn't be rigid—developers should keep them light and flexible to accommodate future changes.

- **Avoiding analysis paralysis**

  - Spending too much time on domain modeling can lead to over-engineering, so keeping things simple and adaptable is key.
