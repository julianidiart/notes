# [Kind Engineering: How To Engineer Kindness by Evan Smith (2021)](https://kind.engineering/)

## 0. What Is Kindness?

> “Kind is about being invested in other people, figuring out how to help them, meeting them where they are.”

### Be Kind, Not Just Nice

> “Nice brings in cake, and we love them for it. Keep bringing in cake! But Kind goes to your manager and says "hey this person is doing great work, consider them for the next lead role", and you never know it happened.”

- **Niceness**: Politeness, external friendliness, and agreeableness.
- **Kindness**: Taking an active role in helping others, being invested in their growth.

### Give & Take: There Are 3 Types Of People In This World

- Based on Adam Grant's _"Give and Take"_, people can be categorized as:

  - **Takers**: Take more than they give.
  - **Matchers**: Give and take equally.
  - **Givers**: Offer more than they take, often helping others.

- **Benefits of Being a Giver (When Done Sustainably)**:

  - Increased productivity.
  - Development of meaningful relationships and networks.
  - More likely to receive help in return.
  - Greater success.
  - Higher levels of happiness.

## 1. Honesty

- **Honesty** fosters _trust_ and creates space for _constructive criticism_.
- Honesty is foundational in _connecting_ with people and _helping_ them effectively.

### Being At Work

- Bring your _full, rounded self_ to work. Share interests and hobbies as part of who you are.
- _Understanding_ your colleagues’ personal stories can help you identify when they need support or feedback.
- Being _open_ about your life humanizes you and helps build trust, though boundaries should be maintained.

- **Building Trust**

  - _Radical Candor_ emphasizes the need for both _honesty_ (to make feedback useful) and _empathy_ (to ensure feedback is constructive and caring). Without honesty, feedback isn’t helpful; without empathy, it isn’t supportive.

- **In Summary:**

  - Be more than _“just professional”_ and bring your rounded self to work.
  - Be open about your life to build trust.
  - Challenge people directly but with care and empathy.

### Be Honest… When It Helps

- While _white lies_ may seem kind, they _don’t help_ people grow or improve.

- **Honest feedback should include:**

  - Praise for _what went well_.
  - Clear explanations of _what went wrong_.
  - Actionable suggestions* for improvement*.
  - For example, instead of falsely praising a failed meeting, offer constructive feedback like, “Your answer was unclear, but the idea is strong. Improve your pitch for better results next time.”

- **In Summary:**

  - White lies may be well-intended but they don’t help with growth.
  - Provide honest feedback by recognizing strengths and suggesting clear ways to improve.

## 2. Async Communication: Code Reviews

- Change is constant in tech, and code reviews (Pull Requests) are essential _asynchronous tools_. They should not be treated as mere formalities but as _opportunities for deeper understanding_.

### Understanding The Why, Not Just The How

- Focus on **The Why** of a change, not just _the What_ and _How_.
- Approach code reviews with _curiosity_, not _condescension_, to avoid defensiveness.
- Assume you might be missing something and ask for _clarification_, _not correction_.
- Use _open-ended questions_ to give colleagues the space to explain their decisions and provide context.

- **In Summary:**

  - Seek to understand the reason behind changes.
  - Avoid assuming incompetence or malice.
  - Use open-ended questions rather than opinionated statements.

### Nitpicks

- **Nitpicks** are _minor_, _non-critical_ comments, often about code style, that don’t need to be addressed before merging code.
- Clearly label nitpicks (e.g., with a _nitpick:_ prefix) to indicate they are optional suggestions.
- If you frequently make the same nitpick comments, consider implementing or improving _linting_ tools to handle style-related feedback automatically.

- **In Summary:**

  - Label nitpicks to clarify their importance.
  - Repeated nitpicks may indicate a need for better tooling.

## 3. Psychological Safety

- **Psychological safety** boils down to one critical question: How safe do you feel in your job calling out problems and fixing them?

- **Impact of Psychological Safety**

  - Feeling unsafe can hinder participation, problem-solving, and innovation.
  - It’s crucial for businesses to be mindful of the psychological impacts of their processes and practices on employees.

### Encourage Feedback

- Create an open environment by seeking out _honest feedback_, including _negative criticism_. This vulnerability builds rapport and trust.
- Ask, _"What went well? What went badly? What can we do in the future?"_ This format helps gather useful insights after a project, meeting, or event.

- **In Summary:**

  - Ask for feedback proactively.
  - Use a straightforward feedback structure: What went well? What went badly? What can we do again?

### Be Inclusive

- Recognize and be open to different _backgrounds_, _histories_, and _preferences_. Inclusivity means understanding people’s needs and meeting them where they are.
- Look for those who contribute less in meetings and find ways to _include_ them. Offer alternative communication methods like sharing documents in advance or using anonymous feedback forms.

- **In Summary:**

  - Be open to diversity and different life experiences.
  - Help those who are less vocal by giving them a platform to express themselves in their own way.

### No Blame

- Failures are often the result of _broken processes_, _environments_, or _workflows_, _not individual mistakes_. Avoid assigning blame to individuals, which fosters distrust and caution.
- Adopt the mindset that _we succeed together, we fail together_. This collective ownership helps people feel safer about identifying and solving problems.

- **In Summary:**

- Individual failures are often process failures.
- Embrace a team-first mindset: We succeed together, we fail together.

### Turn Failure Into Learning

- Each failure or incident should be celebrated as a _learning opportunity_. Failure isn’t absolute but part of the journey toward growth and improvement.
- To foster _innovation_, create an environment where people feel safe to _take risks_ and _experiment_.

- **In Summary:**

  - Celebrate failure as an opportunity for growth.
  - Encourage risk-taking and experimentation to promote innovation.
