# [Scaling Engineering Teams via RFCs: Writing Things Down by Gergely Orosz (2018)](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/scaling-engineering-teams-via-writing-things-down-rfcs/)

## Challenges in engineering planning

- Lack of _visibility_ into others’ work.
- Accumulating tech debt from _inconsistent approaches_ across teams.

## The RFC Process for Effective Engineering Planning

- The recommended process for planning engineering projects:
  1. _Plan_ before building. Discuss or whiteboard the idea with the team.
  2. _Document_ the plan briefly in writing.
  3. Have select _individuals approve_ the plan before work begins.
  4. Send the plan to _all_ engineers for _feedback_ (this may seem “crazy” but is key).
  5. _Iterate_ and tailor the process to suit the organization.

## Benefits of the RFC Process

- Enhances _visibility_ and prevents _duplication_ of work.
- Reduces _architectural debt_ and increases the spread of knowledge across teams.
- Fosters greater _accountability_ and _engagement_ among engineers.

## The Power of Writing Things Down

- Writing improves decision-making by creating _accountability_.
- Examples:
  - Code Quality: Code review in writing before merging.
  - Meeting Efficiency: Written agenda before meetings and follow-up notes afterward.
  - Project Planning: Written plans reduce surprises during project execution.
- Documentation helps _clarify_ misunderstandings and capture different _perspectives_ early.

## Reviewer Feedback and Organizational Knowledge Sharing

- Writing for others to read helps _refine_ thinking.
- Sharing plans across the entire engineering organization (e.g., via email) can seem noisy, but it's _valuable_.
- Pushing plans to everyone encourages an open _culture_ of transparency and shared responsibility.
- Engages engineers beyond their immediate team and creates opportunities for _feedback_ and _learning_.

## Iteration and Tailoring of RFC Process

- At Uber, the RFC process evolved from broad emails to _domain-specific mailing lists_ and _templates_.
- Templates were _refined_ based on repeated reviewer questions. This helped make documents consistent and easier to understand.
