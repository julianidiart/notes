# [A Thorough Team Guide to RFCs by Juan Pablo Buriticá (2021)](https://leaddev.com/software-quality/thorough-team-guide-rfcs)

## Introduction

- RFCs (**Request for Comments**) are a powerful tool for aligning teams and improving _decision-making_.
- Originating in Internet infrastructure, RFCs facilitate _technical discussions_ and _collective decision-making_.

## An Introduction to RFCs

- RFCs date back to _1969_ and were originally used for _Internet infrastructure_ decision-making.
- Now used in _open source projects_ and _engineering teams_ to help make informed technical decisions collectively.

### Why Consider RFCs?

- Using RFCs can lead to better technical decisions by incorporating team _perspectives_.
- Encourages autonomous decision-making while aligning with broader _technical strategies_.
- Writing proposals early helps _manage the costs_ of incorporating changes compared to altering production code.
- Some benefits:
  - Better _collective decision-making_.
  - _Shared understanding_ across the team.
  - Faster identification of _potential issues_.

### Why RFCs Worked for Me

- RFCs are effective for organizations where team members are _empowered_ to make decisions.
- May not be effective if decision-making is tightly controlled by _hierarchy_.

## The Life Cycle of an RFC

1. **Proposing**

- Use _templates_ to create proposals: Google Docs, Dropbox Paper, Notion, Markdown.
- Key Considerations:
  - Drafts can be made openly in a _psychologically safe environment_.
  - Proposals should be about _gathering input_, _not asking for permission_.
  - _Early and iterative feedback_ is critical for evolving proposals.

2. **Commenting or Suggesting**

- Gather _input_ from peers for better decision-making.
- Tool Considerations: Use tools that allow for _threaded discussions_ and _easy feedback_.
- _Moderate_ discussions to prevent them from becoming unproductive.
- Involve _non-engineering stakeholders_ for a broader perspective.

3. **Deciding**

- Facilitate decision-making with _clarity_.
- Alternatives to Approval:
  - Consider a _‘merging’_ phase instead of formal approvals to conclude the commenting period.
  - Encourage a _culture of ownership_ without requiring formal authority for every decision.

4. **Archiving and Updating**

- Keeps a _record_ of decisions for future reference.
- Can be challenging, but archived proposals should serve as a _foundation_ for future ones.

5. **Tooling**

- Key Questions for Choosing **Tools**:
  - Can it be integrated with existing systems?
  - Is commenting, archiving, and classification supported?
  - Does it allow for easy formatting and suggestion resolution?
- Examples of Tools: Google Docs, Markdown in Git repositories, Notion, contract management software.

## Managing Change with RFCs

### Pilot and Measure

- Treat the implementation of RFCs as an _experiment_.
- Example Questions for Evaluation:
  - Have RFCs led to better decision-making?
  - Are team members productively engaging in discussions?
- Write your first RFC about implementing RFCs to lead by example.
- Adjust and iterate on the process based on feedback.

### Scaling Decision-Making

- Define _who_ should be involved in each RFC to avoid overload.
- Regular _architecture reviews_ and _newsletters_ can improve information flow.
- Address the potential for _information overload_ as the process scales.

## Challenges with RFCs

1. **When to RFC**

- Not all decisions require RFCs; some may be better off _directly_ implemented in code.

2. **Domain Ownership**

- RFCs should be within the _scope_ of the responsible domain.

3. **Friction**

- Writing before coding introduces _friction_ but can _improve decisions_.
- Allow for _flexible progress_, _early feedback_, and _clear RFC guidelines_.

4. **Decision Responsibility**

- Avoid _consensus-driven_ decision-making.
- Establish _clear ownership_ to prevent decision blockages.

5. **Tooling Trade-offs**

- No perfect tool exists; use what _fits best_ and be _ready to adapt_.
