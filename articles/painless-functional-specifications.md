# [Painless Functional Specifications – Part 1: Why Bother? by Joel Spolsky (2000)](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/19/where-do-these-people-get-their-unoriginal-ideas/)

- Skipping the specification-writing phase leads to _poor quality_ code and increased project risk.
- Many developers avoid writing specs because they find writing _difficult_ or _time-consuming_.
- Writing specs ensures better _design_, _quality_, and _project efficiency_.
  - Specifications force developers to design programs _carefully_ before coding.
- Writing a spec helps developers thoroughly think through _design choices_ before starting to code.
- Specs act as a _single source of truth_, reducing redundant communication and misunderstandings.
  - Clear specifications facilitate communication across teams (QA, marketing, management, etc.).
  - Specifications help to avoid constant interruptions and miscommunication.
- Specs allow teams to _estimate_ timelines and costs accurately.
  - They are essential for accurate scheduling and decision-making.
- Specs help resolve design debates quickly, preventing unresolved issues from delaying the project.

> "Failing to write a spec is the single biggest unnecessary risk you take in a software project."

> "Writing a spec is a great way to nail down all those irritating design decisions, large and small, that get covered up if you don’t have a spec."
