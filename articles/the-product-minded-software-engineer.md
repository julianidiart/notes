- **Product-Minded Software Engineers** are developers who are deeply invested in the product beyond just coding.

  - These engineers care about understanding the _"why"_ behind decisions, _user behavior_, _business metrics_, and _product goals_.

  3. **Curiosity about "why"**: They constantly ask why certain decisions are made and seek answers autonomously.
  4. **Strong communicators**: They build relationships with non-engineers, learning about other disciplines.
  5. **Balancing product and engineering tradeoffs**: They evaluate both product and engineering aspects when suggesting solutions.
  6. **Pragmatic with edge cases**: They find efficient ways to handle edge cases, considering the minimum _lovable_ product.
  7. **Quick product validation**: They seek early feedback on their work to validate user acceptance.
