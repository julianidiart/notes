- **Code reviews** provide multiple benefits: _error checking_, _knowledge sharing_, and _improving overall team collaboration_.

## Areas Covered by the Code Review

- **Good code reviews**

  - Focus on the _correctness_ of the code, _test coverage_, adherence to _best practices_, and _clarity_.
  - Suggest _breaking down_ large reviews into smaller, manageable parts.

- **Better code reviews**

  - Look at the change in a _larger system context_ and focus on _maintainability_.
  - Ask deeper questions about the _impact_ of the changes on the system's architecture.

## Tone of the Review

- **Good code reviews**

  - Use a _professional_ tone, ask _open-ended questions_, and offer _alternative solutions_ without being overly opinionated.

- **Better code reviews**

  - Show _empathy_, acknowledging the effort the developer put into the change, and are _positive_, praising good solutions.

## Approving vs Requesting Changes

- **Good code reviews**

  - Clearly distinguish between _minor suggestions_ and _blocking issues_.
  - Use _explicit approval signals_ like “Looks good!” or "LGTM" and clearly indicate when follow-up changes are needed.

- **Better code reviews**

  - Allow _flexibility_ in the process, understanding that some changes might be addressed later if the code is urgent.

## From Code Reviews to Talking to Each Other

- **Good code reviews**

  - Leave _detailed comments_ and move to in-person discussions when there’s too much back-and-forth in written reviews.

- **Better code reviews**

  - _Proactively reach out_ to authors after a first pass if there are numerous comments or questions to avoid misunderstandings.

## Nitpicks

- **Good code reviews**

  - _Distinguish_ between critical issues and unimportant "nitpicks," marking them as non-blocking.

- **Better code reviews**

  - Address frequent nitpicks outside of the review process by _advocating for automated tooling or team-wide coding standards_.
    - Too many nitpicks are a sign of lack of tooling or a lack of standards.

## Code Reviews for New Joiners

- **Good code reviews**

  - Maintain the _same quality_ bar for everyone, including new hires, but with a kind tone.

- **Better code reviews**

  - Pay special attention to _explaining_ coding guidelines and celebrate the first few contributions of new joiners.

## Cross-Office, Cross-Time Zone Reviews

- **Good code reviews**

  - Aim to complete reviews during _overlapping work hours_ and offer to talk through complex changes via video call.

- **Better code reviews**

  - Seek _systemic solutions_ to repeated issues caused by cross-time zone dependencies, such as creating new services or refactoring.

## Organizational Support

- **Good code review cultures**

  - Encourage _all_ engineers to participate, raise the quality bar, and include code reviews in job expectations.

- **Better code review cultures**

  - Enforce hard rules around _mandatory_ code reviews, invest in _tooling_ to improve productivity, and provide _organizational support_ for resolving conflicts in reviews.

## Start With Good, Make it Better

- **Good code reviews**

  - Already set a _high bar_ by doing thorough reviews, _avoiding harsh_ tones, and _maintaining standards_ across the board.

- **Better code reviews**

  - Continuously _improve the process_, making them _more empathetic_ and _system-oriented_, and invest in organizational tooling improvements.
