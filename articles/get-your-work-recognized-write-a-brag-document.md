# Get your work recognized: write a brag document

- Good work won't _automatically_ lead to recognition and rewards.
- _Visibility_ and _memory_ play significant roles in how accomplishments are perceived.
- It's disheartening to realize that important contributions go _unnoticed_.
- Often forget significant contributions made over time.
- Write a **Brag Document** (a.k.a, "hype document" or "list of stuff I did.") helps to identify work themes and personal growth, and supports career advancement through documented achievements.

> “There’s this idea that, if you do great work at your job, people will (or should!) automatically recognize that work and reward you for it with promotions / increased pay. In practice, it’s often more complicated than that – some kinds of important work are more visible/memorable than others.”

- **Sharing Your Brag Document**

  - With Your Manager:
    - **Managers** often need help recalling your contributions.
    - A brag document makes it easier for them to advocate for you.
  - With Peer Reviewers:
    - Sharing with peers aids in giving accurate feedback during evaluations.
    - Encourages a culture of recognition within teams.

- Use your document to convey the _broader context_ of your work.
- Areas of focus can include:
  - _Security_ initiatives.
  - _Product skills_ development.
  - _Team culture_ enhancements.
- Update the document every _two weeks_ for ongoing reflection.
- Alternatively, conduct comprehensive reviews _bi-annually_ or _annually_.

- Include fuzzy work:

  - _Code quality_ improvements.
  - Enhancing _on-call processes_.
  - Reducing _technical debt_.
