# Who Needs an Architect? by Martin Fowler (2003)

- There is no single, clear definition of software **architecture**. It is often described as the system’s _organization of significant components_, but this can vary based on the developers' consensus.

> "Architecture is about the important stuff. Whatever that is."

- Architecture is more of a social construct among _expert developers_ than a _technical necessity_. What is considered important is subjective and based on group agreement.
- **Irreversibility and Complexity**: One of the architect’s main tasks is to reduce complexity by making decisions less irreversible, aligning with the agile principle of embracing change.

> "There is no theoretical reason that anything is hard to change about software."

> "Irreversibility was one of the prime drivers of complexity."

> "Making something easy to change makes the overall system a little more complex, and making everything easy to change makes the entire system very complex."

> "An architect’s most important task is to remove architecture by finding ways to eliminate irreversibility in software designs."

- _Architectus Reloadus_, are those architects who makes all the major decisions, and _Architectus Oryzus_, are those who collaborates with the team and fosters a self-sustaining development environment.
- Architecture should not be _rigid_ or established early on but should evolve with the project to handle changes efficiently.
- An effective architect should **mentor** the development team, helping them solve more complex issues themselves, rather than being the sole decision-maker.

> "The architect’s value is inversely proportional to the number of decisions he or she makes."

> "A guide is a more experienced and skillful team member who teaches other team members to better fend for themselves."

- What’s considered part of the architecture depends on what expert developers deem significant, which could be something as complex as image analysis or as simple as persistence layers.

> "In most successful software projects, the expert developers working on that project have a shared understanding of the system design."

- Unlike buildings, software has **no physical constraints**, meaning everything can be designed for change if the team can manage the complexity.

> "Software is not limited by physics, like buildings are. It is limited by imagination, by design, by organization."

> "We have met the enemy, and he is us."
