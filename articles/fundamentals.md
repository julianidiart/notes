# [Fundamentals by Mark Seemann (2024)](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2024/05/20/fundamentals/)

- Focus on concepts like design patterns, SQL, and algorithms rather than specific technologies, as they have broader applications.

- **Design patterns**

  - Understanding patterns helps recognize common solutions across different frameworks and libraries, making new technologies easier to learn.

- **Functional programming**

  - Learn concepts like monads and functors, which apply across various programming languages (e.g., Haskell, C#, Python).

- **SQL and database knowledge**

  - Learning SQL is more valuable than mastering an ORM since SQL fundamentals are stable and widely applicable.

- **HTTP protocol**

  - Knowing the HTTP protocol and tools like curl can help interact with web services effectively, independent of the latest tools.

- **Algorithms and data structures**

  - Understanding structures like trees and graphs aids in solving complex problems more efficiently.

- **Command-line tools**

  - Tools like Git and Bash are useful for automation and version control, providing versatility in various environments.

- **Lifelong learning**

  - Continuous learning of fundamentals enables faster adaptation to new technologies while avoiding burnout.

- **Personal growth**

  - Pursue areas of interest for deeper learning, whether it's machine learning, distributed systems, or compiler design.
