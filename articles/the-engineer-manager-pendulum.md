# [The Engineer/Manager Pendulum by Charity Majors (2017)](https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/)

## Introduction

- Many senior engineers grapple with the decision of becoming managers, often due to a perceived need for _career progression_.
- The author challenges the notion that only management offers _career advancement_ and rejects the idea of staying confined to one role.

## The Pendulum Path

- _Moving_ between engineering and management roles offers a unique career path.
- Engineers who spend time in management and managers who stay close to engineering tend to excel in _both areas_.
- Alternating roles can provide a _broader skill set_ and _deeper understanding_, beneficial for both early-stage companies and restless personalities.

## The Role of a Manager in Technical Fields

- Managers promoted from within bring recent, hands-on technical expertise, enhancing their _credibility_.
- Technical skills fade in management roles; the focus should _shift_ toward improving management capabilities.
- Engineering requires deep focus, while management is _interruption-heavy_. Managers need to prioritize _team support_ over hands-on problem-solving.

## The Role of a Tech Lead

- **Tech Lead = Manager Focused on Tasks**: Unlike a manager, a tech lead’s priority is _project success_ over people management.
- To be effective, tech leads must _leverage management tools_, such as motivating and coordinating teams, breaking down objectives, and assigning meaningful tasks.
- Although less hands-on, tech leads provide organizational direction and are crucial to achieving _technical goals_.

## Benefits of the Pendulum Approach

- Switching roles fosters _understanding of both engineering and business mechanics_, which can seem opaque from a purely engineering perspective.
- Managers learn people skills and conflict management, which enriches their _leadership abilities_.
- Management isn’t a promotion; it’s a _profession change_. Engineers shouldn’t view it as a higher status but as a different, equally valuable skill.
