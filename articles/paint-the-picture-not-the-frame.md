# [Paint the Picture, Not the Frame: How Browsers Provide Everything Users Need by Eric Bailey (2019)](https://alistapart.com/article/paint-the-picture-not-the-frame/)

## Cyberball Experiment

- Purdue University’s Professor Kip Williams used _"cyberball"_ to show the emotional effects of digital exclusion.
- Exclusion in a game with automated participants led to _negative emotions_, regardless of whether the other players were real or robots.
- This effect reveals that digital rejections _harm user autonomy_ and _foster frustration_, even in digital-only settings.

> "People who feel they are rejected by a digital system will feel hurt and have their sense of autonomy reduced, even when they believe there isn’t another human directly responsible"

## Browser Consistency and Customization

### Scroll-to-Top Feature

- Enables _smooth user experience_, especially on content-heavy pages.
- Recommended for _easy access_ and _usability_ with minimal disruption to existing scrolling methods.
- Design tips include respecting reduced motion settings, proper keyboard focus, and avoiding overlap with other UI elements.

### Scrollbars

- Customizing scrollbar appearance disrupts _user expectations_ and creates accessibility challenges.
- External consistency (uniform behavior across platforms) aids in usability for all users.
- _Color contrast_ issues in custom scrollbars may hinder low-vision users.

### Scrolling Behavior and "Scrolljacking"

- Altering scroll behavior without consent _disrupts OS settings_ and can _confuse_ users.
- Scrolljacking restricts _user control_ and can _impair accessibility_ for users with motor control issues.

> "Scrolljacking, as I shall now refer to it both sarcastically and honestly, is a failure of the web designer’s first objective; it attacks a standardised pattern and greedily assumes control over the user’s input."

### Text Highlighting

- Modifying text highlighting can interfere with _readability_ for users with low vision.
- Maintaining system defaults for text highlighting promotes _consistency_ and _respects user preferences_.

### Text Resizing

- Custom resizing widgets lack universal consistency; allowing browser-based text resizing is more _reliable_.
- Increased text sizes should consider all users’ readability needs without requiring extra widgets.

### High-Contrast Themes

- High contrast themes are _essential_ for accessibility but should avoid excessive contrast.
- A _user-driven approach_ (e.g., Windows High Contrast mode) offers customizable palettes.

### Keyboard Focus Navigation

- Moving focus without user action _disrupts navigation_, especially for users reliant on assistive technologies.
- Recommendations include careful use of _tabindex_ and keeping document _order visually_ and _structurally aligned_.

> "Moving focus without their permission means they may be transported to a place where they didn’t intend to go. (...) This is all about consent."

### Clipboard and Browser History Management

- Avoid altering clipboard content or manipulating browser history; _respect user actions_ and _browser defaults_.

## Conclusion

- The web, like "cyberball", should allow _inclusive participation_ without forcing users into passive roles.
- Customizing essential browser functionalities can _alienate users_; sometimes, the best approach is to leave these settings unchanged.
- Ultimately, designing with consistency and accessibility in mind creates a **robust user experience for all**.

> "The web doesn’t have to be one long cyberball experiment. … Sometimes the best strategy is to let things be."
