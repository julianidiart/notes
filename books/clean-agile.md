# Clean Agile (2019)

## Introduction to Agile

### History of Agile

- Agile principles, which focus on small, intermediate goals and progress measurement, have roots in early software development practices.
- These principles were overshadowed by the rise of Scientific Management, which emphasized heavy planning and a top-down approach.

### The Agile Manifesto

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a plan.

### Agile Overview

- Agile is based on continuous feedback and adjustment.
- Agile emphasizes flexibility and responsiveness, with a focus on delivering value regularly through iterative development.

### A Waterfall Project

- Agile integrates analysis, design, and implementation into every iteration, allowing for continuous refinement and realistic project adjustments based on actual progress​.

### The Agile Way

- Agile projects are divided into short, time-boxed iterations or sprints.
- Each sprint includes planning, execution, and review stages, ensuring that feedback is constantly integrated.

### Circle of Life

- Agile is a small discipline that helps small software teams manage small projects. Big projects are made from small projects.

## The Reason for Agile

### Professionalism

- Discipline over ceremonial practices
- Agile disciplines help programmers ensure their software is safe and reliable, reducing the risk of serious errors that could have severe consequences.

### Reasonable Customer Expectations

- Agile aims to meet reasonable customer expectations by ensuring:
  - High-quality software with minimal defects.
  - Continuous technical readiness, meaning the software can be deployed at the end of each iteration.
  - Stable productivity over the course of the project to avoid the common pattern of declining efficiency as projects progress.
- Agile practices promote a sustainable work pace to prevent burnout and encourage collective ownership to avoid knowledge silos.
- Agile supports ongoing improvement and adaptation.

### The Bill of Rights

- Bill of Rights for customers and developers: Emphasizing transparency, mutual respect, and the right to high-quality work.
