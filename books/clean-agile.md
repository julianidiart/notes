## Introduction to Agile

### History of Agile

- Agile principles, which focus on small, intermediate goals and progress measurement, have roots in early software development practices.
- These principles were overshadowed by the rise of Scientific Management, which emphasized heavy planning and a top-down approach.

### The Agile Manifesto

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a plan.

### Agile Overview

- Agile is based on continuous feedback and adjustment.
- Agile emphasizes flexibility and responsiveness, with a focus on delivering value regularly through iterative development.

### A Waterfall Project

- Agile integrates analysis, design, and implementation into every iteration, allowing for continuous refinement and realistic project adjustments based on actual progress​.

### The Agile Way

- Agile projects are divided into short, time-boxed iterations or sprints.
- Each sprint includes planning, execution, and review stages, ensuring that feedback is constantly integrated.

### Circle of Life

- Agile is a small discipline that helps small software teams manage small projects. Big projects are made from small projects.
