# Refactoring UI (2018)

## Starting from Scratch

### Start with a Feature, Not a Layout

- Begin the design process by focusing on a specific feature rather than the overall layout.
  - Example: For a flight booking service, start by designing the flight search feature.
- Avoid designing the app’s shell (navigation bars, sidebars) before understanding the features.

#### Focus on Functionality:

- Design with actual functionality in mind to avoid frustration.
  - Example elements: fields for departure and destination cities, dates, and a search button.

### Detail Comes Later

- In the early stages, avoid getting bogged down by details like typefaces or icons.
- Use simple tools like pen and paper to sketch out ideas without focusing on minute details.

#### Hold the Color

- Start designing in grayscale to ensure strong hierarchy and clarity without relying on color.
- Add color later once the basic design is solid.

#### Don’t Over-Invest in Early Stages:

- Use low-fidelity sketches and wireframes to move quickly and avoid over-investing in static mockups.
- Iterate on a working design rather than trying to perfect everything upfront.

### Don’t design too much

#### Work in Cycles

- Design and build in short cycles, starting with a simple version and iterating based on real use.
- This approach helps address unforeseen complexities more effectively.

#### Be a Pessimist

- Avoid implying functionality that isn’t ready to be built.
- Focus on the simplest useful version of a feature, adding enhancements later.

### Choose a personality

- Determine the design’s personality through concrete elements like font choice, color, border radius, and language.
- Consistency is key to maintaining a cohesive design personality.

### Limit your choices

- Too many options can be paralyzing; limit choices for colors, fonts, and other design elements.
- Use predefined systems to streamline decision-making and avoid fatigue.

#### Systematize Everything

- Establish systems for elements like font sizes, colors, margins, and more to facilitate faster and more confident design decisions.
- Approach design with a mindset focused on creating and utilizing systems to reduce repetitive decision-making.
