# Clean Architecture (2018)

## Part I: Introduction

### Chapter 1: What Is Design and Architecture?

- **Confusion of Terms**:

  - Historically, there has been **confusion** between the terms _design_ and _architecture_.
    - There is **no difference** between the two terms.
    - Common understanding separates _architecture_ (high-level decisions) from _design_ (low-level details).

- **Unified Concept**:

  - _Architecture_ and _design_ form a **continuous fabric**.
  - High-level and low-level decisions are both part of the same **whole** system.
  - No **clear line** divides design and architecture; they are interconnected and interdependent.
  - Just as a house's design includes both high-level aspects (rooms, layout) and low-level details (outlets, switches), **software** architecture includes both **overall structure** and **fine details**.
    - Example: A home design involves decisions about **space layout** (architecture) and **specific elements** like electrical wiring (design).

- **The Goal of Architecture**:

  - The **primary goal** of software architecture is to minimize the **human resources** required to build and maintain the system.
  - A well-designed architecture results in a **lower effort** over the system's lifetime, making it easier to add new features and fix issues.
  - Architecture should **maximize productivity** by making the system flexible and easy to change.

- **Characteristics of Good Architecture**:

  - _Good software architecture_ leads to a **minimal need** for large teams, extensive documentation, or complex tools.
  - **Changes** become simple and rapid, with minimal defects.
  - Systems with poor architecture tend to slow down and become **difficult to maintain** over time.

- **Real-World Implications**:

  - Many developers experience **bad design** that leads to complex, fragile systems.
  - A poorly designed system results in **high coupling**, where small changes can introduce **significant risks** and delays.
  - The **morale of teams** and **success of businesses** can suffer due to poor architectural choices.

- **The Utopian Vision**:

  - The ideal system operates with **minimal intervention** from developers and remains **adaptable** over time.
  - When software architecture is **done right**, it enables **longevity** and reduces the number of required developers.
