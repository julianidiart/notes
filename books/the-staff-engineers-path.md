# The Staff Engineer's Path by Tanya Reilly (2022)

## Part I: The Big Picture

### Chapter 1: What Would You Say You Do Here?

> "Staff engineering roles come in a lot of shapes. There are many valid ways to do the job. But some shapes will be a better fit for some situations, and not all organizations will need all kinds of staff engineers"

#### What Even Is a Staff Engineer?

- **Staff engineers** provide an alternative career path to management for engineers who wish to continue growing technically.
- **Senior engineers** can choose between managerial roles or technical leadership, known as the _"individual contributor"_ track.

- **Why Do We Need Engineers Who Can See the Big Picture?**

  - Senior engineers make _technical decisions_ with _company-wide context_ in mind, beyond their immediate team's interests.
  - Staff engineers avoid local optimization (solving problems only for one team) and focus on solutions that benefit the whole organization.

  > "Good decisions need context. Experienced engineers know that the answer to most technology choices is “it depends.” Knowing the pros and cons of a particular technology isn’t enough—you need to know the local details too. What are you trying to do? How much time, money, and patience do you have? What’s your risk tolerance? What does the business need? That’s the context of the decision."

- **Why Do We Need Engineers Who Lead Projects Across Multiple Teams?**

  - Projects often span multiple teams, with _unclear ownership_ and _unexpected dependencies_.
  - Staff engineers take responsibility for the whole project, ensuring _alignment_, _handling roadblocks_, and maintaining _high technical standards_.

- **Why Do We Need Engineers Who Are a Good Influence?**

  - Senior engineers act as _role models_, shaping not only technical quality but also culture and norms within teams.
  - Their influence ensures _better engineering practices_, like testing, code review, and design quality, and they help set the overall tone for behavior and collaboration.

  > "If the most senior engineers don’t write tests, you’ll never convince everyone else to do it."

#### Enough Philosophy. What's My Job?

- **You’re Not a Manager, but You Are a Leader**

  - Staff engineers hold _leadership_ roles similar in seniority to line managers, but without direct _reports_.
  - Engineers in this role are expected to _guide teams_, _collaborate effectively_, and _influence_ decisions without formal managerial authority.
  - Technical expertise alone isn't enough—staff engineers must develop _collaboration_, _communication_, and _leadership_ skills to influence larger projects.

- **Yes, You Can Be an Introvert. No, You Can’t Be a Jerk.**

  - Leadership can be executed by introverts as long as they maintain _professionalism_ and _collaboration_.
  - Organizations no longer tolerate difficult engineers who harm team productivity, regardless of their technical skills.

- **You’re in a “Technical” Role**

  - Staff engineers must have a _solid technical foundation_ to provide _high-value input_, _guide teams_, and make _informed decisions_.
  - Their role may involve less coding and more _architecture_ and _strategic problem-solving_, leaving programming tasks to others.
  - Depending on the problem, staff engineers may _dive into codebases_, _write technical documents_, or _lead discussions_.

- **You Aim to Be Autonomous**

  - At the staff level, engineers are expected to _identify_ high-impact work rather than wait for assignments.
  - With autonomy comes the responsibility to _speak up_ if a project could be harmful, ensuring decisions are in the organization’s best interest.

- **You Set Technical Direction**

  - A critical part of the role is ensuring that _sound technical decisions_ are made and _documented_.
  - The goal is not to dictate all technical decisions but to ensure that the _right decisions are agreed_ upon and implemented across the organization.

- **You Communicate Often and Well**

  - Senior staff engineers must possess strong _communication_ skills as most of their work involves _conveying ideas_, _aligning teams_, and ensuring smooth _collaboration_.

#### Understanding Your Role

- **Where in the Organization Do You Sit?**

  - Reporting to _higher levels_ (e.g., director) offers _broader perspectives_ but _less time with managers_, while reporting _lower_ (e.g., line managers) provides _closer guidance_ but _limits influence_.

- **What’s Your Scope?**

  > "If anything can be your problem, then it’s easy for everything to become your problem."

  - **Scope** defines the domain a staff engineer is responsible for, with the expectation of influencing both short- and long-term technical goals.
  - _Too broad_ a scope can _dilute impact_, while _too narrow_ a scope _risks missed opportunities_ and _overengineering_.

- **What Shape Is Your Role?**

  > "The work that’s most important will often be the work that nobody else sees."

  - Staff engineers may work deeply in one area or broadly across multiple teams, depending on their _style_ and the _organization's needs_.
  - Engineers need to _balance_ technical skills with product, project, and people management responsibilities as they grow in seniority.

- **The Hyperspecialist Career Path**

  - A **hyperspecialist**, though valuable, may have limited long-term influence in most organizations.

- **How Much Do You Want to Code?**

  - Engineers should consider how much coding they need or want to do and balance it with leadership and strategic responsibilities.

#### Aligning on Scope, Shape, and Primary Focus

- **Is That Your Job?**

  - Ultimately, a staff engineer’s job is to make the organization successful, sometimes stepping into unexpected roles or tasks to achieve project goals.

#### To Recap

- **Ambiguity Is Part of the Role**
- **Leadership without Management**
- **Clear Scope and Focus**

### Chapter 2: Three Maps

#### Uh, Did Anyone Bring a Map?

- **Maps** help to contextualize work and navigate through the organization's structure.

1. **The Locator Map: You Are Here**

- **Purpose**: Understanding your _position_ in the organization.
- Helps in maintaining _perspective_ about the scale of one's work compared to the wider organization.
- _Risks_ Without Perspective:

  - Prioritizing Badly.
  - Losing Empathy.
  - Tuning Out Background Noise.
  - Forgetting the Purpose.

- _Techniques_ for Getting Perspective

  - Take an Outsider View.
  - Escape the Echo Chamber.
  - Go Beyond Engineering.
  - Stay Informed.

2. **Topographical Map: Learning the Terrain**

- **Purpose**: Navigate the organization's _internal terrain_ effectively.
- _Challenges_ Without the Map:

  - Good ideas may not gain traction.
  - Surprises may arise without understanding obstacles beforehand.
  - Progress may be slower due to lack of insight into organizational decision-making.

- **Understanding Organizational Culture**

  - **Questions to Ask**:

    - How much information is shared openly?
    - Are decisions made orally or in writing?
    - Are initiatives top-down or bottom-up?
    - Is there a focus on fast or deliberate change?
    - Are relationships between teams formal or informal?

  - **Cultural Features**:

    - _Gaps_ between different teams or responsibilities.
    - _Gatekeeping_ individuals or teams.
    - Areas of shared or _unclear responsibility_.
    - Established _paths to efficiency_, both documented and undocumented.

- **Keeping Your Topographical Map Up to Date**

  - Join announcement channels, "walk the floor," and talk to people.
  - Build strong networks, even with non-engineers.

3. **Treasure Map: X Marks the Spot**

- **Purpose**: To clarify the organization's goals and define how to achieve them.
- Without clear goals:

  - Teams may struggle with alignment.
  - Short-term focus can hinder long-term achievement and lead to accumulation of technical debt.

- **Taking a Longer View**

  - Understand not just the next step, but the _long-term impact_.
  - Make sure _everyone_ knows the goal and the steps to get there.
  - If there's confusion or no existing goal, help create a _new vision_.

#### Your Personal Journey

- _Track_ your work over _months_, _quarters_, and _years_.
- Understand your goals and progress to frame even small tasks in the context of a _bigger story_.
- Define your journey clearly.

#### To Recap

- Practice seeing the _bigger picture_ intentionally.
- Know the _context_, _culture_, and _goals_ of your organization.
- Keep the maps up to date and navigate by understanding _how decisions are made_.
- _Build relationships_, _gather information_, and _connect people_ to help the entire organization move toward its goals.
