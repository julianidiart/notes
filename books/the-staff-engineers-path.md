# The Staff Engineer's Path by Tanya Reilly (2022)

## Part I: The Big Picture

### Chapter 1: What Would You Say You Do Here?

> "Staff engineering roles come in a lot of shapes. There are many valid ways to do the job. But some shapes will be a better fit for some situations, and not all organizations will need all kinds of staff engineers"

#### What Even Is a Staff Engineer?

- **Staff engineers** provide an alternative career path to management for engineers who wish to continue growing technically.
- **Senior engineers** can choose between managerial roles or technical leadership, known as the _"individual contributor"_ track.

- **Why Do We Need Engineers Who Can See the Big Picture?**

  - Senior engineers make _technical decisions_ with _company-wide context_ in mind, beyond their immediate team's interests.
  - Staff engineers avoid local optimization (solving problems only for one team) and focus on solutions that benefit the whole organization.

  > "Good decisions need context. The local maximum, the best decision for a single group, might not be anything like the best decision when you take a broader view."

- **Why Do We Need Engineers Who Lead Projects Across Multiple Teams?**

  - Projects often span multiple teams, with _unclear ownership_ and _unexpected dependencies_.
  - Staff engineers take responsibility for the whole project, ensuring _alignment_, _handling roadblocks_, and maintaining _high technical standards_.

- **Why Do We Need Engineers Who Are a Good Influence?**

  - Senior engineers act as _role models_, shaping not only technical quality but also culture and norms within teams.
  - Their influence ensures _better engineering practices_, like testing, code review, and design quality, and they help set the overall tone for behavior and collaboration.

  > "If the most senior engineers don’t write tests, you’ll never convince everyone else to do it."

#### Enough Philosophy. What's My Job?

- **You’re Not a Manager, but You Are a Leader**

  - Staff engineers hold _leadership_ roles similar in seniority to line managers, but without direct _reports_.
  - Engineers in this role are expected to _guide teams_, _collaborate effectively_, and _influence_ decisions without formal managerial authority.
  - Technical expertise alone isn't enough—staff engineers must develop _collaboration_, _communication_, and _leadership_ skills to influence larger projects.

- **Yes, You Can Be an Introvert. No, You Can’t Be a Jerk.**

  - Leadership can be executed by introverts as long as they maintain _professionalism_ and _collaboration_.
  - Organizations no longer tolerate difficult engineers who harm team productivity, regardless of their technical skills.

- **You’re in a “Technical” Role**

  - Staff engineers must have a _solid technical foundation_ to provide _high-value input_, _guide teams_, and make _informed decisions_.
  - Their role may involve less coding and more _architecture_ and _strategic problem-solving_, leaving programming tasks to others.
  - Depending on the problem, staff engineers may _dive into codebases_, _write technical documents_, or _lead discussions_.

- **You Aim to Be Autonomous**

  - At the staff level, engineers are expected to _identify_ high-impact work rather than wait for assignments.
  - With autonomy comes the responsibility to _speak up_ if a project could be harmful, ensuring decisions are in the organization’s best interest.

- **You Set Technical Direction**

  - A critical part of the role is ensuring that _sound technical decisions_ are made and _documented_.
  - The goal is not to dictate all technical decisions but to ensure that the _right decisions are agreed_ upon and implemented across the organization.

- **You Communicate Often and Well**

  - Senior staff engineers must possess strong _communication_ skills as most of their work involves _conveying ideas_, _aligning teams_, and ensuring smooth _collaboration_.

#### Understanding Your Role

- **Where in the Organization Do You Sit?**

  - Reporting to _higher levels_ (e.g., director) offers _broader perspectives_ but _less time with managers_, while reporting _lower_ (e.g., line managers) provides _closer guidance_ but _limits influence_.

- **What’s Your Scope?**

  - **Scope** defines the domain a staff engineer is responsible for, with the expectation of influencing both short- and long-term technical goals.
  - _Too broad_ a scope can _dilute impact_, while _too narrow_ a scope _risks missed opportunities_ and _overengineering_.

- **What Shape Is Your Role?**

  - Staff engineers may work deeply in one area or broadly across multiple teams, depending on their _style_ and the _organization's needs_.
  - Engineers need to _balance_ technical skills with product, project, and people management responsibilities as they grow in seniority.

- **The Hyperspecialist Career Path**

  - A **hyperspecialist**, though valuable, may have limited long-term influence in most organizations.

- **How Much Do You Want to Code?**

  - Engineers should consider how much coding they need or want to do and balance it with leadership and strategic responsibilities.

#### Aligning on Scope, Shape, and Primary Focus

- **Is That Your Job?**

  - Ultimately, a staff engineer’s job is to make the organization successful, sometimes stepping into unexpected roles or tasks to achieve project goals.

#### To Recap

- **Ambiguity Is Part of the Role**
- **Leadership without Management**
- **Clear Scope and Focus**
