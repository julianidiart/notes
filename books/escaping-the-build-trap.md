# Escaping the Build Trap (2019)

## Part I: The Build Trap

- **Build Trap**: Organizations measure success by outputs (features delivered) rather than outcomes (customer value).
- Focuses on shipping features rather than solving real problems for customers, leading to disruption and loss of market share.
- To escape the Build Trap, companies must develop robust _product management_ practices that focus on creating customer value.

### Chapter 1: The Value Exchange System

- Customers have problems, wants, and needs; businesses provide products or services to fulfill them.
- Value is realized only when products solve customer problems, leading to reciprocal business value.
- Companies often equate value with the number of features delivered rather than the real customer outcomes.

### Chapter 2: Constraints on the Value Exchange System

- Customers are influenced by external factors (community, technology).
- Businesses are constrained by internal policies, processes, and resources, which need to be optimized for delivering customer value.

### Chapter 3: Projects Versus Products Versus Services

- **Projects**: Discrete, one-off scopes of work with deadlines.
- **Products**: Continuous vehicles of value that need ongoing attention and development.
- **Services**: Human-delivered value propositions.
- Companies in the Build Trap tend to manage their products like projects, leading to a lack of strategic growth.

### Chapter 4: The Product-Led Organization

- **Sales-Led**: Product strategy is driven by contracts and customer promises, leading to feature bloat.
- **Visionary-Led**: Relies on a visionary leader for product direction, often unsustainable when that person leaves.
- **Technology-Led**: Driven by tech advancements rather than market needs, leading to misalignment with customer desires.
- **Product-Led**: Optimizes for business outcomes by aligning product strategy with company goals, continually creating value for customers.

### Chapter 5: What We Know and What We Don’t

- Product development is filled with unknowns, and it is important to distinguish between what is known and what still needs to be discovered:
  - **Known Knowns**: These are facts that are well-established, such as customer requirements, data from past performance, or regulatory needs. Known knowns are reliable and should be treated as the foundation for decision-making in product development.
  - **Known Unknowns**: These are assumptions or uncertainties you know you need to clarify. These might include gaps in understanding customer behavior or missing data points. These are areas that can be investigated through _experimentation_, _customer feedback_, or _research_ to turn them into known facts.
  - **Unknown Knowns**: These refer to _intuitions_ or gut feelings based on past experiences. Although intuition can be valuable, it is also where _bias_ can thrive. Intuition must be tested and validated through experimentation before being used to drive decisions.
  - **Unknown Unknowns**: These are the factors or issues that you do not even know exist, making them impossible to ask questions about or plan for. They often emerge unexpectedly during _customer interactions_ or while analyzing unrelated data, revealing insights that could reshape your product or strategy.
- Product managers must focus on identifying and exploring the _known unknowns_ while reducing the impact of _unknown unknowns_ through constant learning and iteration.

## Part II: The Role of the Product Manager

### Chapter 6: Bad Product Manager Archetypes

- **Mini-CEO Archetype**: Effective product managers rely on influence, not authority.
- **Waiter Archetype**: Takes orders from stakeholders without understanding or questioning. Lacks strategic thinking and prioritization, leading to a feature-factory mindset.
- **Former Project Manager Archetype**: Focuses on deadlines and deliverables rather than the “why” behind product decisions. Lacks understanding of customer problems and how to create business value.

### Chapter 7: A Great Product Manager

- Understand _business goals_, _user problems_, and _market needs_.
- Work collaboratively with teams, influence decision-making, and guide product vision.
- Product managers should focus on identifying and validating customer problems before proposing solutions.
- Effective product managers facilitate the team’s collective knowledge.
- Successful product managers listen, learn, and use data to make decisions, not ego or intuition.

### Chapter 8: The Product Manager Career Path

- **Associate Product Manager**:
  - Entry role, often lacks formal training in product management.
  - Must develop foundational skills in working with development teams and gathering customer insights.
- **Product Manager**:
  - Owns a feature or set of features.
  - Balances short-term operational tasks with long-term strategic thinking.
  - Works with UX and development to deliver solutions.
- **Senior Product Manager**:
  - Oversees more complex products or a broader scope.
  - Balances strategic vision and operational responsibilities without direct reports.
- **Director of Product**:
  - Oversees a team of product managers.
  - Responsible for product vision, operational efficiency, and strategic alignment within a product line or portfolio.
- **VP of Product**:
  - Connects company goals with product lines, accountable for the financial success of the product.
  - Guides the overall product strategy and aligns teams toward business outcomes.
- **Chief Product Officer (CPO)**:
  - Oversees the entire product portfolio.
  - Ensures strategic alignment across all product lines and communicates with the board on product decisions and financial impacts.

### Chapter 9: Organizing Your Teams

- Organizing around technical components or features can lead to inefficient work and lack of alignment with goals.
- Aligning teams with _value streams_ helps to focus on delivering outcomes and customer value.
- Teams organized around strategic goals (e.g., retention, new users) rather than product features or components.
- Product teams should be aligned with clear product vision and strategy to ensure successful execution.

## Part III: Strategy

### Chapter 10: What Is Strategy?

- _Strategy_ is a framework for making decisions, not a detailed plan.
- A _good strategy_ focuses on goals, vision, and higher-level objectives, enabling flexibility in achieving outcomes.
- A _bad strategy_ is too rigid, feature-based, and often dictated without validating assumptions.
- Effective strategy includes defining the “why” before the “what” and “how”.
- Strategy shouldn't be treated as a fixed plan that stifles experimentation and adaptability.

### Chapter 11: Strategic Gaps

- Gaps that prevent companies from achieving strategic outcomes:
  - **The Knowledge Gap**: Difference between what management knows and what they want to know.
  - **The Alignment Gap**: Discrepancy between what teams do and what management expects.
  - **The Effects Gap**: Difference between expected outcomes and actual results.
- Communicate strategic intent (high-level goals) rather than detailed instructions and allow teams to figure out how to achieve outcomes.

### Chapter 12: Creating a Good Strategic Framework

- A _strategic framework_ links the company's vision to product portfolio and initiatives.
- Strategy creation involves setting a vision (long-term goal) and strategic intents (focused, mid-term objectives).
- Companies must avoid _yearly planning mode_, where goals and budgets are set once a year, limiting flexibility.
- Fund product initiatives incrementally as they validate success, similar to VC funding.
- Strategy Deployment
  - Align strategy across the organization by setting goals for each level (executives, managers, teams).
  - **Vision**: High-level, long-term goal.
  - Specific mid-term outcomes aligned to the vision.
  - **Product Initiatives**: Specific product-driven objectives that support the strategic intents.
  - **Options**: Possible solutions or tactics explored to meet product initiatives.

### Chapter 13: Company-Level Vision and Strategic Intents

- The _company vision_ sets long-term direction, guiding the company’s efforts and giving meaning to product decisions.
  - Vision should be clear, memorable, and actionable. It explains the why and how of the company’s goals.
- The _strategic intents_ are outcome-focused goals that help achieve the vision.
  - The strategic intents should be concise and few in number to avoid spreading resources thin.

### Chapter 14: Product Vision and Portfolio

- The _product vision_ communicates the problem the product solves and the value proposition for users.
  - Should not focus on specific features but rather on the outcomes and capabilities the product enables.
  - Aligns the team around solving specific user problems.
- The _product portfolio_ is a collection of products that work together to support the company’s vision.
  - The CPO oversees the product portfolio to ensure products work in harmony and align with business goals.

## Part IV: Product Management Process

### The Product Kata

- _Product Kata_ is a systematic approach to building the right product through experimentation, based on Toyota's Improvement Kata.
  1. Set the goal.
  2. Understand where you are currently.
  3. Identify obstacles to reaching the goal.
  4. Plan how to solve the obstacle.
  5. Experiment and measure results.
- This process promotes an experimental mindset, focusing on problem-solving and validating solutions through data-driven learning.

### Understanding the Direction and Setting Success Metrics

- **Vanity Metrics**: Metrics that look impressive but don’t drive meaningful business decisions.
- **Actionable Metrics**: Metrics that provide clear insights into what actions should be taken.
- **Pirate Metrics** (AARRR):
  - Acquisition: How users find you.
  - Activation: First positive interaction with your product.
  - Retention: Keeping users engaged over time.
  - Referral: Users recommending your product.
  - Revenue: Monetizing the product.
- **HEART Metrics**: A framework from Google for user experience (UX) metrics: Happiness, Engagement, Adoption, Retention, and Task Success.
- **Setting Success Metrics**: Define both leading and lagging indicators to measure short-term and long-term success. Focus on outcome-based metrics rather than outputs.

### Problem Exploration

- Understanding customer problems by going beyond quantitative data, including interviews and observations.
- Identifying underlying problems customers face, rather than assuming what the solution should be.
- Focusing too early on a solution without fully understanding the problem can lead to wasteful product development.
- Use user research, surveys, and observations to uncover the real customer issues before moving into solutions.

### Solution Exploration

- **Concierge Experiment**: Manually delivering the service to the customer to understand their needs without building the full solution.
- **Wizard of Oz**: Presenting a product that appears automated but is operated manually behind the scenes.
- **Concept Testing**: Showing early prototypes, wireframes, or video demonstrations to gauge user reactions and feedback.
- Focus on validating ideas and solving user problems before fully developing a solution.
- For simple problems, solutions may be obvious, but for more complex issues, experimentation is key to learning.

### Building and Optimizing Your Solution

- **Building with Intent**:
  - Develop solutions based on validated learnings from previous experiments.
  - Use a _North Star_ document and story mapping to align the team around a shared product vision.
  - Prioritize work using frameworks like _Cost of Delay_, which helps evaluate the urgency and value of features.
- **Definition of Done**: Not just about shipping a feature but ensuring it achieves the desired outcome.
- Post-launch, measure the solution’s impact and continuously refine based on user feedback and performance metrics.

## Part V: The Product-Led Organization

### Outcome-Focused Communication

- **Quarterly Business Reviews**: Review progress toward strategic intents and business outcomes. The leadership team evaluates financial performance, customer outcomes, and the impact of product initiatives.
- **Product Initiative Reviews**: Product teams assess the progress of options against product initiatives, presenting experiment results, releases, and asking for additional funding.
- **Release Reviews**: Monthly meetings to showcase upcoming releases and their expected outcomes, ensuring alignment across teams.
- _Roadmaps_ should not be static Gantt charts but dynamic documents that reflect the evolving nature of strategy, product initiatives, and development stages (Experiment, Alpha, Beta, General Availability).
- A clear communication strategy ensures that sales teams know what products are available and what to expect in the near term, avoiding the pitfalls of over-promising features.

### Rewards and Incentives

- **Current Reward Structures**: Often, bonuses and incentives are tied to output-based measures like the number of features shipped, which reinforces the build trap.
- **Outcome-Based Rewards**: Organizations should align incentives with business outcomes, customer satisfaction, and learning. Product managers and teams should be rewarded for achieving real impact rather than shipping features.
- Product managers should push back against incentives that encourage feature output. Aligning reward structures with the success of outcomes will prevent teams from gaming the system to "check off" deliverables without adding real value.
- Adjust sales compensation to include metrics for retention and customer satisfaction to prevent over-promising and churn.

### Safety and Learning

- Innovative organizations create a culture where teams can fail and learn without fear of punishment. Failure should be seen as part of the learning process, provided it leads to improved outcomes.
- Failure should not be celebrated in isolation—learning from failure and applying those lessons is key.
- Experimenting early reduces the risk of large, costly failures. Teams that learn from small failures can mitigate larger risks down the line.
- Leaders should set boundaries (e.g., time, budget) for experimentation but give teams enough autonomy to explore new ideas and solutions.
- Rolling out new features to a smaller group of users (_Alpha_, _Beta_) helps to minimize the risk of large-scale failures and allows for iterative improvements before general release.

### Budgeting

- Yearly budgets that are tied to feature roadmaps often limit flexibility, force teams to build unnecessary features, and prevent adaptation during the year.
- Treat product development like a _venture capitalist_ would: fund small bets, validate their success, and scale up investments as solutions prove viable.
- Continuously allocate funds based on product team performance, learning, and outcomes. Adjust investments to reflect progress rather than locking teams into rigid yearly budgets.
- Teams should not feel compelled to spend their entire yearly budget if a project does not prove to be valuable. Budgeting should incentivize learning and value creation over spending for the sake of it.

### Customer Centricity

- **Customer-Centric Mindset**: Being product-led means deeply understanding the customer’s needs and continuously solving their problems.
- Successful product-led companies, like John Deere and Amazon, ensure their teams regularly _interact with customers_ to stay aligned with their needs and evolving problems.

### Marquetly: The Product-Led Company

- The company escaped the build trap by adopting an outcome-oriented, customer-centric mindset. It aligned the entire organization around strategic goals and invested in experimentation to find the right solutions.
- Success hinged on the CEO’s commitment to changing the company’s culture and mindset.
- By continuously focusing on solving customer problems and iterating based on feedback, Marquetly grew significantly, ultimately leading to its acquisition.
- The shift from feature output to outcome-based success was gradual but critical. Product managers were empowered to focus on learning and experimentation, leading to a more innovative, adaptable company.
