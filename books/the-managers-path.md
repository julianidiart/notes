  - **Neglectful Managers**: Ignore employees' needs, provide little feedback, and offer sudden negative evaluations.
  - **Micromanagers**: Control every aspect of work and limit decision-making.
  - **Abusive Managers**: Provide no support until they want to criticize.
  - **Effective Managers**: Invest in employees' growth, provide guidance, and encourage focus on priorities.

- Create a personal connection and build _trust_.
- Provide a _private space_ for discussions.

  - Employees should bring an _agenda_.
  - Not just for status updates, use email/chat for that.
