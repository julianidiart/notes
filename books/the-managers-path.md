- **Productivity & Work Allocation**

  - Allocate _20% of time for sustaining work_ (testing, debugging, and maintenance).

- **Deadline Management**

  - _Cut_ project scope near deadlines to meet key goals.
  - Work with tech leads and product managers to _prioritize features_.
  - _Balance_ technical feasibility with product requirements.

- **Estimation Best Practices**

  - Use the _doubling rule_ for quick estimates but allocate planning time for long-term tasks.
  - Be _selective_ about estimation requests to avoid distracting engineers.
  - Establish _structured team-wide processes_ for evaluating new projects.

- **Onboarding as a New Engineering Manager**

  - Get an overview of _system architecture_ and _development processes_.
  - _Participate_ in code reviews, deployments, and feature development.
  - Work on _at least one or two features within the first 60 days_.
  - _Shadow engineers_ and gain hands-on technical experience.
  - Prioritize _technical credibility_ to earn team trust.
