#### Project Management Rules of Thumb

- **General Approach**

  - _Agile project management_ is preferred over rigid waterfall planning.
  - Maintain a _balance between long-term goals and short-term execution_.
  - Ensure the _team collaborates on planning and estimates_.

- **Productivity & Work Allocation**

  - _10 productive engineering weeks per quarter per engineer_ (factoring in vacations, meetings, and other disruptions).
  - Allocate _20% of time for sustaining work_ (testing, debugging, and maintenance).

- **Deadline Management**

  - _Cut_ project scope near deadlines to meet key goals.
  - Work with tech leads and product managers to _prioritize features_.
  - _Balance_ technical feasibility with product requirements.

- **Estimation Best Practices**

  - Use the _doubling rule_ for quick estimates but allocate planning time for long-term tasks.

### Managing Your Time: What’s Important, Anyway?

- **Tasks fall into four quadrants:**

  - **Important & Urgent** → Must do _immediately_ (e.g., fixing outages, performance reviews).
  - **Important but Not Urgent** → Need to _make time_ for (e.g., preparing for meetings, hiring plans).
  - **Urgent but Not Important** → Often _distractions_ (e.g., excessive email/chat responses).
  - **Not Important & Not Urgent** → Should _avoid_ (e.g., social media distractions).

- _Urgency_ is often mistaken for _importance_ (e.g., emails and chat feel urgent but aren’t).
- Meetings should be evaluated for necessity; _unnecessary meetings waste time_.
- Managers must handle both _current team issues and future planning_.
- Managers must _prioritize management_ over coding when needed.

### Decisions and Delegation

- Attending meetings helps recognize _team dynamics_.
- _Regular 1-1 meetings are crucial_ to spotting early signs of disengagement or potential resignations.
- Use _complexity and frequency_ to determine what to delegate:
  - **Simple & Frequent**: _Delegate_ (e.g., standups, status reports).
  - **Simple & Infrequent**: _Do it yourself_ (e.g., occasional admin tasks).
  - **Complex & Infrequent**: _Train rising leaders_ (e.g., performance reviews).
  - **Complex & Frequent**: _Delegate_ to develop your team (e.g., project planning).
- Managers should ensure their _teams operate efficiently without relying too much on them_.
- **Warning Signs of Team Issues**
  - **Disengaged Employees**: Less interaction, avoiding meetings, leaving early.
  - **Tech Lead Avoidance**: Skipping 1-1s, vague updates, possible project delays.
  - **Low Energy Meetings**: Lack of participation suggests disengagement.
  - **Constantly Changing Priorities**: The team lacks a clear long-term vision.
  - **Fragmented Knowledge**: Teams work in silos and resist collaboration.

### Challenging Situations: Strategies for Saying No

1. **“Yes, and” Approach**

- Instead of a direct “no,” respond with a _“yes, and”_ to negotiate priorities.
  - Example: “Yes, we can do that project, and we will need to delay another one.”
- Helps _frame discussions positively_ rather than shutting ideas down.

2. **Create Policies**

- Develop clear guidelines to _standardize decisions_.
- _Prevents repeating_ the same reasoning for similar requests.
  - Example: Setting criteria for adopting new programming languages.

3. **“Help Me Say Yes”**

- _Engage in discussions_ to understand and refine ideas.
- Encourages team members to _evaluate their own proposals critically_.
- Can lead to _self-realization_ that an idea may not be feasible.

4. **Appeal to Budget and Resources**

- Use time and _budget constraints_ to justify decisions.
- _“Not right now”_ can be a softer way to decline but should be used carefully.

5. **Work as a Team**

- _Coordinate_ with peers to support or reinforce a “no.”
  - Example: Using financial constraints to reject budget-heavy requests.
- Can help gain _support for future decisions_.

6. **Be Direct and Decisive**

- _Say no quickly when necessary_ rather than delaying.
- Reduces _unnecessary back-and-forth_.
- If wrong, _acknowledge_ and adjust later.

### Technical Elements Beyond Code
