# System Design Interview by Alex Xu (2020)

## Chapter 1: Scale From Zero to Millions of Users

- Scaling a system into manageable steps starts with a simple single-server setup. As traffic grows, the system must evolve by introducing load balancers, separating web and data tiers, implementing database replication, and introducing caches. Horizontal scaling becomes essential once vertical scaling reaches its limits. The chapter also covers the importance of content delivery networks (CDNs) and caching, database sharding, and state management. At each level of scale, redundancy, availability, and performance optimization are considered.

- **Single server setup**: Everything (web, cache, database) runs on a single server initially.

  > "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and building a complex system is no different."

  - A _single-server setup_ works for small-scale systems but lacks redundancy and scalability.

- **Traffic management**: Use load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple servers as the user base grows.

  > "A load balancer evenly distributes incoming traffic among web servers that are defined in a load-balanced set."

  - _Load balancers_ help distribute traffic across multiple servers, preventing any server from being overwhelmed.

- **Database scaling**: Separate databases from the web tier for better performance and scalability; introduce replication and sharding for scaling.

  - _Scaling_ the database involves separating the web and database tiers and choosing between SQL and NoSQL based on the applicationâ€™s needs.

- **Vertical vs. horizontal scaling**: Vertical scaling has limits, horizontal scaling provides better redundancy.

  > "Vertical scaling has a hard limit. It is impossible to add unlimited CPU and memory to a single server."
  > "Horizontal scaling allows you to scale by adding more servers into your pool of resources."

  - _Vertical scaling_ adds power to a single server but has limits; _horizontal scaling_ distributes load across multiple servers for better performance.

- **Database replication**: Master-slave replication improves performance and reliability.

  > "In the master-slave model, all writes and updates happen in master nodes; whereas, read operations are distributed across slave nodes."

  - Database replication improves read performance and adds redundancy, allowing the system to handle failures.

- **Caching**: Implement a cache tier to store frequently accessed data and reduce the load on databases.

  > "A cache is a temporary storage area that stores the result of expensive responses or frequently accessed data in memory so that subsequent requests are served more quickly."

  - Adding caching at the server or application level reduces database load and improves response times.

- **CDN usage**: Use a CDN to deliver static content (images, videos) to users from locations closer to them, improving response times.

  - A CDN ensures static assets are served quickly by caching them at edge locations close to users.

- **Stateless web tier**: Moving state information (like user sessions) out of web servers into shared storage allows for easier scaling and better fault tolerance.

  > "Stateless architecture: HTTP requests from users can be sent to any web servers, which fetch state data from a shared data store."

  - Moving to a stateless web tier allows easier scaling by adding or removing web servers based on demand.

- **Sharding**: Split large datasets across multiple databases, allowing for greater scalability while handling huge amounts of data.

- **Failure management**: Introduce failover mechanisms to deal with server or database crashes, maintaining availability.

- **Decoupling system components**: Use message queues to decouple system components and enable independent scaling of different services.

- **Global scaling**: Support multiple data centers across different regions to ensure low latency for a global user base.

  - Supporting multiple data centers also provides disaster recovery and improves performance for users in different geographical locations.

- **Message queues**: Asynchronous message processing decouples components and improves scalability.

  > "A message queue is a durable component, stored in memory, that supports asynchronous communication."

  - Using a message queue decouples tasks like image processing, allowing the system to handle asynchronous processing without delaying user responses.

## Chapter 2: Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation

- _Back-of-the-envelope calculations_ are quick estimations, which are essential during system design interviews. These estimates help assess system capacity or performance based on general assumptions and approximations. Jeff Dean, a Google Senior Fellow, emphasizes that these calculations provide a sense of whether a design can meet given requirements.

  > "Back-of-the-envelope calculations are estimates you create using a combination of thought experiments and common performance numbers to get a good feel for which designs will meet your requirements."

  > "You need to have a good sense of scalability basics to effectively carry out back-of-the-envelope estimation."

  > "Commonly asked back-of-the-envelope estimations: QPS, peak QPS, storage, cache, number of servers, etc."

  > "Back-of-the-envelope estimation is all about the process. Solving the problem is more important than obtaining results."

- **Power of Two**: Data is typically represented using _powers of two_. Understanding basic units, such as bytes, kilobytes, and gigabytes, is crucial when estimating data storage and transfer needs.

  > "Although data volume can become enormous when dealing with distributed systems, calculation all boils down to the basics."

- **Latency Numbers**: _Latency_ refers to the time delay in system operations. Typical latency values for operations like reading from memory or disk, performing network requests, and more. These numbers help approximate time-sensitive system requirements.

  > "Latencies you should be familiar with: memory access is fast, but disk access is slow. Avoid disk seeks if possible."

- **Availability Numbers**: This refers to _system uptime_, measured as a percentage (e.g., 99.9% uptime). System reliability is crucial, and service-level agreements (SLAs) with customers typically specify availability requirements.

  > "Most services fall between 99% and 100% availability. The more nines, the better."

- **Tips for Estimations**:

  - **Rounding and Approximation**: Complex calculations should be simplified using rough approximations during interviews.

  > "It is difficult to perform complicated math operations during the interview. Precision is not expected. Use round numbers and approximation to your advantage."

  - **Assumptions**: Clearly state your assumptions when making estimates. These provide a framework for further calculations and justifications.

  > "Write down your assumptions. It is a good idea to write down your assumptions to be referenced later."

  - **Unit Labeling**: Always label units (e.g., KB, MB, GB) to avoid confusion.

  > "Label your units. When you write down '5', does it mean 5 KB or 5 MB? You might confuse yourself with this."

## Chapter 3: A Framework for System Design Interviews

- The primary goal is not to design a perfect solution but to demonstrate how well candidates approach problems, ask clarifying questions, and handle feedback.
- While technical proficiency is important, the interview assesses much more, such as collaboration, communication, and problem-solving under pressure. Red flags include over-engineering and rigidness in design.

- **4 Steps Framework**

  1. **Understand the Problem and Establish the Design Scope**

  - Ask clarifying questions and ensuring that both the interviewer and candidate are aligned on the requirements

    - What features are we going to build?
    - How many users does the product serve?
    - What are the expected scale and performance metrics?
    - What are the non-functional requirements such as latency, reliability, and availability?

  > In a system design interview, giving out an answer quickly without thinking gives you no bonus points. Answering without a thorough understanding of the requirements is a huge red flag.

  > When you ask a question, the interviewer either answers your question directly or asks you to make your assumptions. If the latter happens, write down your assumptions on the whiteboard or paper.

  2. **Propose a High-Level Design and Get Buy-In**

  - Propose a high-level system architecture that covers major components like databases, caches, load balancers, and APIs.
    - Break the system into logical parts, such as client-server interactions, data storage, caching, etc.
    - Use diagrams to visualize components and their relationships.
    - Communicate your assumptions and decision-making process.

  > The problem is open-ended, and there is no perfect answer. The final design is less important compared to the work you put in the design process.

  3. **Dive Deeper into Specific Components**

  - Focus on specific areas for a deep dive. Common topics for discussion include system bottlenecks, database design, consistency models, scalability, and failure handling.
    - Database architecture (sharding, replication)
    - Caching strategies
    - Load balancing
    - Handling high availability and fault tolerance

  > Let the interviewer know what you are thinking. Communicate with your interview.

  4. **Wrap Up**

  - Summarize design and address potential improvements.
    - Bottleneck identification and performance improvements
    - How the design can evolve with scale
    - Error handling strategies
    - Monitoring and operational considerations

- **Dos**

  - **Ask for clarification**: It is essential to clarify vague or ambiguous requirements.
  - **Collaborate**: Treat the interviewer as a team member, sharing and iterating on ideas.
  - **Think aloud**: Continuously share your thought process to provide clarity.
  - **Discuss trade-offs**: Weighing pros and cons shows your ability to make informed decisions.
  - **Get feedback**: Engage the interviewer frequently for validation.

- **Dont's**

  - **Avoid rushing**: Do not jump to a solution without thoroughly understanding the problem.
  - **Avoid over-engineering**: Focus on practical, not overly complex, solutions.
  - **Donâ€™t be silent**: Engage continuously rather than thinking in isolation.
  - **Donâ€™t neglect to summarize**: Always wrap up your design with a summary and highlight improvements.
