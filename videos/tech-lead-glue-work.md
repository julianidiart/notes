- **What is Glue Work?**

  - **Glue work** involves crucial but often overlooked activities that help engineering teams succeed like:
    - _Onboarding_ new team members.
    - Updating _roadmaps_.
    - Reviewing _design documents_.
    - Helping _unblock_ team members.
  - Glue work is often not recognized as _"technical"_, which can lead to career stagnation.

- **The Story of an Engineer Doing Glue Work**

  - A new engineer starts out with difficulties in the codebase, unsure of her contributions.
  - She manually helps customers, writes onboarding documents, and creates team processes.
    - She helps set company coding _standards_, builds a _mentorship_ program, and _resolves blockers_ for team members.
    - The team treats her as an _informal lead_, but her contributions aren’t seen as _"technical enough"_ for promotion.

- **The Challenge: Glue Work and Career Growth**

  - Glue work is often _undervalued_ in traditional engineering performance evaluations.
    - Coding and direct technical contributions are prioritized over _"soft"_ contributions.
    - The engineer is advised to _switch to a project manager_ role rather than being promoted as an engineer.

- **Why Fair Allocation of Glue Work Matters**

  - Glue work is crucial for successful projects.
  - Women and other underrepresented groups are _more likely to take on glue work_
    - Studies show that women volunteer for non-promotable work more often.
    - Managers also assign thankless tasks disproportionately to women.

- **Choosing Roles Deliberately**

  - Individuals should decide what they want to get better at, rather than being pushed into roles they don’t want.
  - It’s important to be deliberate about the skills one develops on the job.

> "Choose deliberately. Choose a role that you'll feel successful and happy and proud to say you do, and that will teach you skills you want."

- **Steps for Making Glue Work Visible and Valuable**

  1. Honest discussions about promotion paths and goals are critical.
  2. Titles like _"Tech Lead"_ can provide legitimacy to glue work contributions.
  3. Create artifacts that show the _impact_ of glue work, such as _design documents_ and _meeting notes_.
  4. If glue work isn’t recognized, consider focusing on quantifiable technical work temporarily to get promoted.

- **Reducing the Glue Burden to Advance**

  - Stop organizing team events, mentoring, and other glue tasks.
  - Focus instead on coding, designing, or other visible technical contributions.

> "If you’re not getting promoted for glue work… stop doing glue work."

- **Learning and Growth**

  - Most skill acquisition happens _during work_. Engineers should:
    - Focus on developing both _technical_ and _leadership_ skills.
    - _Share_ their learning experiences to support junior team members.
  - Even for those excelling at glue work, it's important to keep developing _core technical skills_ to ensure career growth.

> "If you only do glue, you will only get better at glue. You're making your team more effective but you're hurting your future self."

- **Managers and Teams: Allocating Glue Work Fairly**

  - Managers should ensure that glue work is _shared equitably_ among team members.
  - Promotion processes should consider glue work as an _essential component of technical leadership_.

> "Managers: If your job ladder doesn't require that your senior people have glue work skills, think about how you're expecting that work to get done."

> "Glue people: push back on requests to do more than your fair share of non-promotable work and put your effort into something you want to get good at."

- **Conclusion: Developing Versatility**

  - Glue work is _essential_ for team success, and it needs to be _recognized_ and _rewarded_ appropriately.
  - Engineers should _decide deliberately_ what skills they want to develop and should resist being boxed into roles they don’t aspire to.
  - Everyone can be good at multiple things and should _actively decide_ on a career path that makes them _fulfilled_.

> "Our skills aren't fixed in place. You can be good at lots of things. You can do anything."
