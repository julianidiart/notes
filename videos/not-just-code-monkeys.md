## Agile Development: Beyond Just Writing Code

### Agile’s evolution and its unintended consequence

- Agile originally aimed to increase _collaboration_ between business and developers.
- However, it has sometimes resulted in developers becoming passive recipients of tasks.

### The problem: Developers as mere executors

- Stories (tasks) often _flow one-way_ from business analysts to developers.
- Developers focus only on _execution rather than collaborating_ on what should be built.
- Agile’s founders would be horrified by this approach.

## Developers as Collaborative Decision-Makers

### The power of conversation

- Kent Beck suggested calling Agile _“Conversational Software Development.”_
- Developers should _participate in deciding_ what features make sense, not just implement them.

### Example: Amazon Shopping Cart A/B Test

- A developer proposed suggesting additional items in the shopping cart.
- Business team rejected the idea, fearing it would distract customers.
- Developer ran an _A/B test_ proving increased revenue.
- Result: Feature was adopted—showing the value of experimentation and collaboration.

> "There's no rule that says all ideas must come from the business side."

## Understanding the Domain: A Developer's Responsibility

### Developers should engage with the industry they work in

- Many developers prefer just coding rather than _understanding the business domain_.
- This _limits_ their ability to _add real value_ through insights and innovation.

### Example: ThoughtWorks database project

- A business user saw a data visualization and asked, _"Can you also answer these business questions?"_
  - The answer was yes, and _the new feature alone justified the project cost_.
  - The opportunity only arose because developers _engaged in the conversation_.

## Ethical Responsibility in Software Development

### Dark Patterns: The Ethics of Manipulative Design

- Some software is designed to _exploit users_, e.g.,
  - Auto-adding unwanted items to a shopping cart.
  - Tricky subscription cancellation processes.
- Developers writing such code are as _responsible_ as those who request it.

> "You are responsible for the decision to write that code and you have to balance that responsibility across everything else."

### Choosing ethical work

- Fowler turned down a lucrative career in finance after realizing it didn’t add real value.
- Instead, he found healthcare more meaningful, as doctors and nurses truly cared about their users (patients).

## The Bigger Picture: Tech’s Impact on Society

1. **Diversity & Inclusion in Tech**

   - The lack of women and marginalized groups in tech is a serious problem.
   - Tech prides itself on meritocracy, but when 50% of the population is missing, that claim is weak.
   - Everyone in the industry must _take action_ against exclusion and harassment.

2. **Online Privacy & Surveillance**

   - Governments and corporations increasingly _monitor online activity_.
   - Software engineers have a responsibility to _defend user privacy_.
   - Fowler urges the audience to attend his later talk on _"Defending the Free Internet."_
